## Synopsis

This project is an idea-list application that keeps track of important ideas one is interested in.  The application was developed in order to practice using localStorage as well as continue practice using jQuery for logic and DOM manipulation.  This project was developed for a class at the Turing School of Software and Design.

## Usage
One needs to enter the name of their idea along with any information related to the topic.  Upon clicking the save button, a new card is generated that contains the information for the new page.  One can also click on the text and edit the content on the card.  The content will then be saved so that upon refresh, it will reflect the changes.  The user may also vote their idea up or down depending on what quality they believe their idea is.  If the user would like to delete the idea, they can press the x button at the top right corner.  All changes made to ideas are then saved upon refresh.  Finally, one can search through their ideas in the search bar.  It will filter the ideas with similar characters in title, body, and quality.
